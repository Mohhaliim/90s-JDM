              The RX nomenclature plays a massively important role in Mazda’s past – historically, anything bearing the
              name has also had a rotary engine, but the RX-7 always had just that little bit more panache than its
              related RX family. the third and final generation that was built over the course of 10 years, between
              1992 and 2002. </p>

            <h1>Honda NSX</h1>
            <p>Honda decided to create a sports car that is completely different from the rest, one that could be fun,
              simple and even practical. One that could shred a racetrack and pick up groceries at the same time.
              Management told development that they had high expectations for the car, as they wanted it to be as fast
              as something out of Germany or Italy. They decided a benchmark for their new car, the Ferrari 328, which
              changed into the Ferrari 348 as it was unveiled while the car was still under development.</p>

              The fifth iteration of the Lancer Evolution, known as the Mitsubishi Evo 5, was launched in January 1998.
              A new World Rally Championships category that permitted more extensive modification on cars came about in
              1997. While other car manufactures were producing new World Rally Cars, Mitsubishi Motors chose to
              continue its policy of building technological elements required to improve the performance of its rally
              machines into its production models. And therefore, continued participating in Group A with the Evo 5.

              The EK9 was one of the best performance hatches to come out of Japan during the 1990s. Good ones are
              becoming harder and harder to find and the car has become somewhat of a classic ,Honda introduced the EK9
              Civic Type R in 1997 and it shared many characteristics with the Integra Type R. The car was put on a
              serious diet and anything unnecessary, such the sound deadening was removed.
